Jimmy stares at the man and the man stares back. Jimmy didn't feel like answering the man's riddle, so he decided to try and stare him down. Unfortunately, the man is nothing but a hallucination created by the beans Jimmy ate, and Jimmy proceeds to die of starvation trying to stare down his own imagination. Quite unfortunate.
