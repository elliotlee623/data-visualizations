Jimmy woke up feeling quite groggy. As he regained his senses, he looked around. He seemed to be trapped in a maze, yet he had no recollection of how he ended up in this predicament. In any case, there were 3 paths in front of him. Also, there was an Oak tree planted nearby, for some strange reason. He got up and decided that the only thing he could do was try and find his way out of this maze. Should he take the left path, the center path, or the right path?
